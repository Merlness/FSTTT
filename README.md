## Tic Tac Toe in F#

Hi! This is my simple Tic Tac Toe game in F#.

To get started, letâ€™s install [.NET SDK.](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download/dotnet/6.0) 

Make sure you have the necessary tools and plugins for your IDE.

If you have a Mac [this could be helpful.](https://fsharp.org/use/mac/)

You can use VS Studio, I used Rider from JetBrains. 
This does not work with IntelliJ!


### Run the Game

Navigate to the FSTTT/FSTTT directory where you have the game files. Then, to start the game, use:

    dotnet run

Don't forget to have a good time, since you won't be able to beat my AI!


### Running Tests

If you want to run the tests to make sure everything is working properly, stay in the same FSTTT/FSTTT directory and run the tests with:

     dotnet test
